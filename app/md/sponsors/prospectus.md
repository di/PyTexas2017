# Sponsor Prospectus

Presenting PyTexas 2017, the 9th Annual Python Community Conference for the 
Texas Region. The purpose of PyTexas is to share Python-related knowledge and 
enthusiasm in the form of presentations, coding sprints, "teach me" sessions, 
and general networking among developers. It is run every year by volunteers 
from around the region.

In 2012, PyTexas received national recognition from former Python Software 
Foundation chair Steve Holden as a regional conference that deserves the Python 
community's support.

Please consider sponsoring PyTexas 2017 through a financial contribution to the
non-profit PyTexas Foundation. Your contribution helps the Texas-area Python
community build a better conference, while also providing a targeted marketing
and community outreach opportunity.

We have provided this prospectus for potential sponsors to find out more about 
the conference itself and available sponsorship opportunities. Our contact 
information is available immediately below if you have any questions.

## Why Sponsor?

As a sponsor, your funding assistance will serve three critical purposes:

1. Highlight your presence within the Texas Python community. You can use this to:
    - Recruit your next engineer
    - Drive adoption of your product
    - Simply show your support for the Texas Python community
1. Build a better PyTexas by enabling organizers to attract attendees with standard conference perks such as printed t-shirts, swag bags, catering, professional A/V, and more.
1. Help keep the cost of PyTexas low. PyTexas 2017 attendees will pay a modest 
    registration fee, and almost all of this fee will go to the rental of our 
    venue. Your sponsorship helps us keep this price reasonable for everyone 
    involved.

## Sponsorship Opportunities

We offer several standard packages. However, if none of these seem to fit, 
please feel free to contact the Sponsor Chair (above). We want to help you make the
most of your investment in the Python community.

### Have an Idea?

Do you have an idea for a package or exclusive benefit you’d like to see at 
PyTexas? We’re open to them! Contact the Sponsor Chair to discuss what you’d 
like to do.

### Prizes

Each year, PyTexas features prize drawings for attendees, with gifts generously 
donated from sponsors. Anyone is welcome to donate prizes for these drawings. 
This is a great way to get the word out about your product.

## About the Python Language

Python is a general purpose, open source programming language popular for its 
elegant, high-level, and cross-platform design. It is protected and promoted by 
the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/). The PSF also aids
organizers of local conferences such as PyTexas with financial and logistical support.

Python has a wide range of practical uses, from simple scripts to large scale 
enterprise applications to high volume websites such as YouTube.

Python is used for system administration, web development, building GUI 
applications, scientific computing, game development, and as a "glue" language 
for systems integration, among other things. Python developers have many 
choices of runtime environments, including CPython, JVM (Jython), and .NET 
(IronPython).

See [http://www.python.org/about/quotes/](http://www.python.org/about/quotes/) to find out
how organizations around the world are using Python.
